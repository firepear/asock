Automated socket module
#######################

Asock provides a fire-and-forget way to add network interfaces to
servers written in Go. It handles network I/O and dispatches requests
from clients. All you need to do is watch its messaging channel for
events you'd like to log or act upon.

What is it used for?
====================

Asock's original use case was administrative sockets. Say you've
written a piece of server software which allows people to store and
retrieve information about their yo-yo collections. Yo-yo data
insertion and fetching is its public interface, exposed to the
internet.

You may wish to instrument the server for monitoring, or you may wish
for a way to alter its configuration on the fly, or other similar
things. You could add these capabilities to the public interface,
either hoping that other people don't stumble upon them, or fencing
them off with an authentication scheme of some sort.

But you could also add a second interface, which is only exposed to
the machine the server is running on (typically via Unix domain
sockets), and is expressly for administrative purposes. Asock makes it
easy to provide that private interface.

Now that TCP connections are supported as well, Asock makes it easy to
add call/response type interfaces to any piece of software.

Do not use Asock on the internet!
---------------------------------

Asock does not yet have any concept of security, or authentication, or
rate-limiting, or maximum transfer sizes.  It is not currently safe to
use on networks which are publicly routable!

How is it used?

::

    func hollaback(s []string) ([]byte, error){
        // a trivial echo server implementation
        return []byte(strings.Join(s, " ")), nil
    }
    
    func set_things_up() {
        // populate a dispatch table
        d := make(asock.Dispatch)
        d["echo"] = hollaback
        
        // instantiate a socket (/tmp/echosock or /var/run/echosock),
        // with no connection timeout, which will generate maximal
        // informational messages
        as, err := asock.NewUnix("echosock", d, 0, asock.All)
        
        // if err is nil, the socket is now up and handling requests.
        // if a client connects and sends a message beginning with
        // "echo", the rest of the message will be dispatched to
        // hollaback(). Its return value will then be sent to the client.
        ...    
    }

    // ...then, in an eventloop elsewhere...
    select {
    case msg := <-as.Msgr:
        // Msgr is the message channel from asock. Handle
        // messages and error notifications here.
    case your_other_stuff:
        ...
    }

See the package doc for complete information on setup options and usage.
