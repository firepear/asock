0.6.0 - 2015-01-17

  Breaking changes

    * New() now has a 4th argument, messaging level, which controls
      which messages will be sent to a.Msgr

  Nonbreaking changes

    * Msg type is now far more robust, enabling better
      logging. Concommitantly, Msg.Txt is now generally more terse,
      since more information is elsewhere

    * All Msgs now have a numeric Code field, which accurately
      identifies what sort of message it is

    * A Msg is now generated when a response is sent to a client

    * Improved test coverage

  Bugfixes

    * A response is no longer sent when the request generates an error

    * Connection closures due to timeout now generate a Msg indicating
      server-side closure instead of client-side closure

  Breaking changes

    * Socket names are no longer automagic. They are now an argument
      to New()

    * Negative timeout values now set a connection deadline in
      addition to creating a one-shot connection (e.g. -5 creates a
      one-shot conn with a 5 second deadline)

    * All dispatches now generate a Msg, not just those which fail

  Nonbreaking changes

    * sockAccept() and connHandler() are now part of Adminsock's
      methodset, eliminating several arguments to each
